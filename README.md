# CentriCare-Health
A Security domain project which ensures the authentication and access provision to the authorized users based on the roles. 

# Overview
During the progression of my degree program here at VIT, as I got an opportunity to study and learn about the fundamentals of computer science and programming, associated advanced topics of cloud computing and networks, in conjunction with the systems and technologies implemented in healthcare and bioinformatics - and the associated laws and regulation in place to protect and safeguard patient/customer information; I explored further into the ever evolving dimension of cyber security risk and threats in this domain.

# Motive and Research
Upon researching more, I gathered that despite modern applications and systems put in place by organizations of all scales and sizes, and their respective IT and engineering teams, the common pitfall is the lack of security focus in the product/system design and implementation. It is no surprise that poorly engineered applications and systems (which though may be very robust in delivering the intended capability, but have a security oversight) lead to catastrophic security failures and incidents, resultign in breaches and loss of confidential information, which in turn spirals into monetary and reputational risk/loss to the organization, and puts public health and safety in jeopardy.

# Project Proposal and Objectives
Along the same lines, my project proposal is to develop and demonstrate a cloud application security assessment, based on the industry-accepted frameworks such as CIS, ATT&CK and NIST.

High-level objectives of the project are:
- Review and deployment of a cloud-native healthcare application
- Implementation of Azure cloud and its offered compute, storage and serverless technologies
- Implementation of Terraform and Git for IAC(infrastructure as code) and code versioning
- Reproducing a data breach in a controlled lab environment
- Analysis of technical issues and shortcomings of the current state
- Advising on security gaps and mitigation strategies
- Implementation of security controls
- Validating the security assessment analysis
- Project summary and closure
